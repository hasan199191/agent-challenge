Lifestyle Trend Analysis:

Regular tracking of your daily habits provides valuable insights into your health patterns. Here's what to look for:

SLEEP PATTERNS:
- Consistency in bedtime and wake time
- Correlation between sleep quality and daily activities
- Impact of screen time and caffeine on sleep

HYDRATION TRENDS:
- Daily water intake consistency
- Relationship between hydration and energy levels
- Seasonal variations in water consumption

ACTIVITY LEVELS:
- Weekly step count patterns
- Correlation between activity and mood/sleep
- Impact of weather and schedule on movement

SCREEN TIME HABITS:
- Daily and weekly screen time patterns
- Relationship between screen time and sleep quality
- Productivity correlation with screen time limits

Key insights emerge after 2-4 weeks of consistent tracking. Use this data to make informed adjustments to your lifestyle.
